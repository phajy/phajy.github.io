I am looking for a postdoc to work on Black Hole Astrophysics. The deadline for application is 5th March 2024.

I was fortunate to be awarded an STFC grant that will fund a three-year postdoctoral position to work on X-ray spectral and timing observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The goal is to use our new general relativistic ray tracing package [`Gradus.jl`](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/Gradus.jl) to fit data to learn about the geometry of the accretion disc, corona, and spacetime. These observations can also be used to test general relativity, looking for departures from the standard Kerr metric, for example.

Most information about the job and applications can be made via the [University of Bristol web site](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=335198&jobTitle=Research%20Associate%20in%20Black%20Hole%20Astrophysics).
