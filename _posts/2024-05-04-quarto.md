title: Quarto Lecture Notes
---

Several people have asked me how I prepare my lectures notes in HTML and PDF format. Here's an overview of my workflow, with a detailed step-by-step guide. This is *slightly* different to how I do it because I use a "book" project rather than a "website" project, but the principles are the same.

Here's an [example web site](https://phajy.github.io/andys-quarto-example/geodesics.html).

- I keep my notes in a GitHub repository which lets me keep track of changes and acts as a non-local backup. This would also work really well for collaborative projects. You do not need to use [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- The notes are written in [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) (plain text), using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) syntax for the mathematics <!-- (although I wonder if I'd use typst if starting afresh). -->
- The Markdown files are rendered into various formats, including HTML and PDF, using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Interestingly, Quarto will also allow you to embed code blocks in your documents which I have not had time to do properly, but I plan to use this feature in the future
- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor which has a [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) (see also the [Quarto documentation relarding the extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html)) which can render the documents and prepare previews. You may use a different editor.
- For my lecture notes I have hosted these on a University affiliated service, however, it you can publish the web pages on GitHub which sounds very attractive. I've tested this out, and it works (see below)!

Here's a detailed walkthrough:

## Set up an empty GitHub repository

I first set up a blank repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Initially this just contains a `README.md` file and a `LICENSE`. I have somewhat arbitrarily chosen the MIT license, "A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices." Alternatively, you can create the Quarto project then push the whole thing to GitHub -- whichever order you find more convenient.

The repository I have created is called [andys-quarto-example](https://github.com/phajy/andys-quarto-example).

## Install Quarto

You need to install Quarto. You can follow these on-line [instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). On my Mac I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a package manager which you can use to [install Quarto](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/quarto#default) using `brew install --cask quarto`.

## Set up VS Code

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor. In VS Code you can install a [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

## Start a new Quarto project

In VS Code you can create a new Quarto project -- on the Mac this is shift-command-P, then type "Quarto: Create New Project", then select "Website Project". This will create a skeleton project.

However, I find it easier just to add a few files to my repository. I have added the following files:

- `_quarto.yml` which contains the configuration for the project.
- `index.md` which is the main page of the website.
- `about.md` which is a second page of the website.
- `style.css` which is a CSS file to style the website (initially empty).

You can see the content of these files in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phajy/andys-quarto-example).

## Publishing the website

You can publish the website following the [Quarto GitHub pages instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

To do this make some edits to your `_quarto.yml` file and add an empty `.nojekyll` file to the root of your project. You can then render the web page in VS Code by selecting "Quarto: Render Website" from the command palette.

Push this to GitHub. On the GitHub web page you can go to the settings page for the repository, select "Pages" from the left hand menu, then choose "Deploy from a branch", and select "main" "/docs". That should publish the first version of your website. This is the easiest way. You can set up a GitHub action, which is probably *better* but I have not done this yet.

This is what I have done to produce the following web page [https://phajy.github.io/andys-quarto-example/](https://phajy.github.io/andys-quarto-example/).

## Add some content

I have created an additional page called "Geodesics" and added a link to this in the `_quarto.yml` file. The content of this page starts off as follows.

```markdown
## Parallel-transport and geodesics

Here is an excerpt from the GR lecture notes.

![Parallel transport of a vector $\vec{v}(\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is an affine parameter. For geodesics the vector $\vec{v}$ is a tangent vector, $\vec{u}(\lambda)$.](parallel_transport.png){width=300 #fig-parallel-transport}

We can use the idea of parallel transport to construct *geodesics*, defined as curves that parallel-transport their own tangent vectors. That is, for a geodesic

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pmb{\nabla}_{\vec u} {\vec u} &= 0 \\
    \text{i.e.} \qquad u^\beta {u^\alpha}_{;\beta} &= 0 \\
    \text{i.e.} \qquad u^\beta {u^\alpha}_{,\beta} +
        {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} u^\beta u^\gamma &= 0 \\
    \text{or} \qquad \frac{d}{d\lambda} \left( \frac{d x^\alpha}{d\lambda}
        \right) + {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} \frac{d x^\beta}{d\lambda} \frac{d
        x^\gamma}{d\lambda} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

where in the last of these expressions (often called the *geodesic equation*, though the first is also the geodesic equation), $\lambda$ is a continuous parameter along the curve.
```

A few things to note:

- The heading is a second-level heading, `## Parallel-transport and geodesics`.
- The figure is included with Quarto syntax `![caption](filename){width=300 #label}`.
- Italics are generated with `*italics*`, and bold text with `**bold**`, following the standard Markdown syntax.
- LaTeX mathematics is included between `$$` delimiters for "dislpay" maths and between `$` delimiters for "inline" maths.
