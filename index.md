Andrew Young is an Associate Professor in the School of Physics at the University of Bristol. His research interests include numerical and observational astrophysics focused on accreting black holes. The numerical work involves the development of general relativistic models of the time-dependent spectra of accretion flows with different disc, corona, and spacetime geometries. The observational work concerns the analysis of X-ray data from accreting black holes using telescopes such as *XMM-Newton*, *Chandra*, and *NuSTAR*.
